# Multiprocessing

Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes (independent units of a program) simultaneously. Each process has its memory space, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks.

### Usage

- Ideal for CPU-bound tasks: Data processing, mathematical operations and data analysis.
- Can be more complex to implement than threading due to separate memory spaces.
- Bypasses the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) since each process operates independently.

```python
import multiprocessing

def worker():
    print("Process is working")

# Create a process
process = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)
process.start()
process.join()  # Wait for the process to finish
```

## Importance

Multiprocessing is essential for CPU-intensive tasks that cannot be efficiently handled using threads due to GIL limitations.
