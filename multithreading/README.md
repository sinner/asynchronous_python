# Threading

Threading allows you to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within a single process. Threads share the same memory space, making it suitable for I/O-bound tasks.

### Usage:

- Ideal for I/O-bound tasks: Reading/writing files, network operations.
- Can be simpler to implement than multiprocessing for certain tasks.

```python
import threading

def worker():
    print("Thread is working")

# Create a thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)
thread.start()
thread.join()  # Wait for the thread to finish
```

### Importance:

Threading is important for performing tasks such as network calls concurrently without blocking the main application.

# AsyncIO

asyncio is a library in Python that provides tools for managing I/O-bound tasks asynchronously. It uses an event loop to manage multiple tasks concurrently. asyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax, suitable for I/O-bound tasks.

### Usage:

- Ideal for I/O-bound tasks: Network requests, file operations.
- Can be more complex to implement than threading but provides better performance.
- Allows for writing portable concurrent code in a single-threaded environment.
- Efficiently handles many I/O-bound operations using coroutines.

```python
import asyncio

async def worker():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulates an I/O-bound task
    print("Task finished")

# Create an event loop
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(worker())
```

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulates an I/O-bound task
    print("Task finished")

# Run the asynchronous function
asyncio.run(main())
```
